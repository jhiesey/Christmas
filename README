This is my hacked christmas lights controller project.

Inspiration and some technical details gotten from
http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/

The basic design consists of a hardware board with a PIC24FJ64GB002
processor that interfaces to a computer via USB using the communications
device class (hence no drivers are needed, except on Windows). Simple
Python scripts can be written to control the lights.

The ./controller directory contains the Python code that runs on the PC
side, including some examples of pattern controllers, most of which
are pretty lame.

The ./Christmas.X directory contains the embedded C/assembly
code that runs on the microcontroller in a MPLAB X project.
